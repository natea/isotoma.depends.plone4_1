Description: Plone 4.1
        =========
        
        This egg just depends on all the eggs needed for Plone 4.1.
        
        If you need to override an egg dragged in by this package you cannot use this package.
        
        This is meant for crazy fools using virtualenv instead of buildout.
        
        You need to depend on isotoma.depends.zope2_13_8 as well if you want this to work.
